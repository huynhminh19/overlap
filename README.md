# Quickstart in Development

Build docker:
```
make build
```

Run test:
```
make test
```

Run API:
```
make dev
```

We can now access our API, both from the command-line, using tools like ```curl```...

Or directly through the browser, by going to the URL ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/vouchers/```...
